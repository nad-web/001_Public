# Focus Flow — implementation case study

**Release:** 1.0.0 · **Date:** 28 October 2026 · **Author/portfolio owner:** Noorullah Adel

## Problem and audience

Starting a focused session can feel harder than the work itself. Intended audience: Students and independent workers.

## Implemented first version

Configurable focus and break lengths; start/pause/reset; stored deadline; manual next session; completed-session count; optional notifications.

## Technical decisions

Browser-only HTML, CSS, and ES modules keep this app deployable on GitHub Pages. Shared modules provide safe DOM construction, optional versioned browser storage, exports, import checks, and tested pure functions. App-specific logic remains in its app entry or a clearly named shared engine used by two related apps. Install manifests and a content-versioned service worker support a Home Screen and cached-offline experience without an application server.

## Validation evidence

The browser scenario passed for: start, pause, elapsed-time calculation, and completion using a controlled browser clock. All 20 app pages were also checked at 320, 390, and 1440 px for horizontal overflow and at mobile width with axe WCAG A/AA tags; no serious or critical automated violations were found in that checked initial state. The offline test cached the actual deployment and navigated to all 20 apps with the network disabled. Relevant calculation/import invariants are tested in `tests/apps.test.mjs`. Exact suite evidence is recorded in the root validation document.

## AI collaboration

The user selected the portfolio scope, categories, GitHub destination, and Noorullah branding. The assistant generated the implementation and test code, reviewed the source, ran the tests, and corrected observed issues. No claim is made that a human software reviewer independently audited this release.

## Limits and tradeoffs

A browser can suspend timers when locked or closed. The saved deadline catches up when reopened; this is not a dependable background alarm. This release has not yet been uploaded by the owner, and a physical iPhone/Safari installation check is still needed. Browser emulation and Chromium tests do not prove Safari compatibility or guarantee future cache retention.

## Next improvement

Gather feedback from the deployed app and test the real iPhone user flow before extending its scope. Keep source, tests, and the data explanation aligned with any later changes.
